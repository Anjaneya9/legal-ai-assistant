# Legal AI Assistant

A React Native mobile application that bridges the gap between complex legal AI systems and real people making decisions. This app provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with legal AI, analyze documents, and access legal knowledge.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native + Expo**: Core framework for cross-platform mobile development
- **Expo Router**: For navigation and routing
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **React Native StyleSheet**: For styling components
- **Lucide Icons**: For consistent and beautiful iconography

## Design Rationale

This application follows a human-first design approach, focused on making complex legal concepts accessible to everyone. The design emphasizes:

1. **Clarity and Simplicity**: Legal concepts are presented in plain language with a clean interface
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex information is revealed gradually to avoid overwhelming users
3. **Contextual Assistance**: The AI assistant provides relevant guidance based on user needs
4. **Aesthetic Minimalism**: A clean design that focuses on content and functionality
